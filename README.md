# Module-8-Challenge
 
The purpose of this challenge is to extract, clean and transform data. We first import the CSV file and then create a DataFrame. after cleaning and reordering the columns of the dataframe we then export it as "backers.csv".

Then we update our ERD to show the relationship between the backers data and the other data from earlier in the module. Then we imported the "backers.csv" file into our created backers table in our database.
